abstract:

Gnocchi is a time series database written in Python, that has been created in the context of the OpenStack cloud computing project. It offers highly-scalable data storage for measurements and provides access to its data via a REST API.
In this lecture, we'll discuss the features the project is offering to its users, and how they can easily be leveraged in any application. In a second part, we'll see how the project has been built to scale, how Python was leveraged and made scalable.
