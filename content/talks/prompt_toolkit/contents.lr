abstract:

Two years ago at Fosdem 2015, I presented prompt_toolkit, a library for building command line applications.
A lot of progress was made, and it became the foundation for the UI in many tools, including IPython, http-prompt, xonsh and others.

During this talk, we'll have a look at how prompt_toolkit progressed, how it became successful, how it created a community/ecosystem of many new command line applications, and the future.
